# fruit-ninja
This project is a gesture-controlled Fruit Ninja game built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. It uses real-time hand tracking to detect your index finger and lets you slice fruits on screen just by moving your hand in front of the webcam. The game includes scoring, a 30-second timer, and optional slicing sound effects using PyGame.
